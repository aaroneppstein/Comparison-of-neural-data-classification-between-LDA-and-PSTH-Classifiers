# Comparison-of-neural-data-classification-between-LDA-and-PSTH-Classifiers
Final Project for UC Davis graduate class BIM 289, Design of Neural Control Systems

Final Project built on multiple homeworks from the class. Neural data pulled independently from a rat model was classified using a PSTH based Minimum Euclidian Distance Classifier developed by the professor of the class, Dr Karen Moxon. This was then compared to the more historically used Linear Discriminant Analysis Classifier.
